## Getting Started

There are many hidden and private channels on the open Slack for specific sub-projects, which you are very welcome to join.

We recommend that you announce yourself to the group on **#general** and state your interests, so that we can involve you as much as possible.

Once on Slack, you'll find the following channels interesting:

### Non-technical chats:
- **#general** - general updates, opportunities and chat
- **#random** - random off-topic chat

### Technical chats:
- **#activation** - live QA of new OpenActive datasets
- **#public-openactive-w3c** - a chat for help implementing standards
- **#w3c-cg-github** - live updates of standards discussions on GitHub, focussed on updating and maintaining standards
