# OpenActive W3C Community Group open chat

Please join the W3C Community Group chat via one of the following means:

- If you are part of the [OpenActive community](https://www.openactive.io/pioneers.html), you can join the chat via the **#open-w3c-cg** channel in the [OpenActive community slack](https://openactive.slack.com/signup)

- Join the chat on Gitter from anywhere via [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/openactive/public-openactive-w3c](https://badges.gitter.im/openactive/public-openactive-w3c.svg)](https://gitter.im/openactive/public-openactive-w3c?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) or via the [Gitter desktop and mobiles apps](https://gitter.im/apps)

- If you already use Slack within your organisation, bridge this chat to a channel in your own Slack using the [OpenActive Sameroom portal](https://sameroom.io/xWXUNJUc) (we recommend bridging it to #public-openactive-w3c to make its openness clear to other Slack users)
